## Description
The confluence of a 1975 article by Vine Deloria, Jr., and a 2025 law review article sparks a conversation about what's roiling our minds at the moment.

Steve and I discuss the strange and startling implications arising from originally free peoples turning toward the domination system that attacks their free existence. 

Does it mean that the “boarding schools” were successful? That Henry Pratt succeeded in “killing the Indian and saving the man”?
